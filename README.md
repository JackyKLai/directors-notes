# Director's Notes
Taking timestamped notes on a video
## Prerequisite
On Windows (MacOS doesn't seem to have this problem), the built-in video player only supports the .avi format natively. For .mp4 and other formats, download a codec like [this one](http://www.codecguide.com/configuration_tips.htm?version=1570) before launching the app.
## Usage
### Getting Started
Import a video by going to File -> Load Video, then start a new session (File -> Start Session -> New). Enter your name in the prompt and click ok.
### Adding and editing a note
Use the slider and the play-pause button to stop at a frame. You can add a note by clicking on the bottom left "Add Note" button. Double-clicking on a note takes you to the timestamp it refers to in the video. Selecting the note in the list on the left enables the "Edit" button. After editing the content of a note, click on the same button to save changes.
### Comments
You can leave comments on a note by selecting it and clicking on the "Comment" button. Comments can only be left on a note and can't be edited. If you don't like what you've entered, you can delete a comment or a note by selecting it and clicking on the "Delete" button.
### Tags and filters
You can add tags to a note. The available tags are, as you can see at the bottom right of the window:
* General
* Sound
* Music
* Colour
* VFX

Using the drop-down menu at the top right corner, you can filter notes based on the tags you assigned to them.
### Exporting notes
Export your notes by going to File -> Export Session. The exported .pkl file should be small enough to share on any social platform. Make sure that your collaborator also has the same video file you left notes on.
### Logging back in
To load notes (a .pkl file) back into the app, go to File -> Start Session -> Load from file. Then choose an existing user to log in or create a new one.
