Timestamped note-taking app
## Prerequisite

## Releases
Releases can be found [here](https://github.com/JackyKLai/directors-notes/releases).
## Usage
### Getting Started
Notes are stored in a data file in the .pkl format. If you have a notes file ready, go to File -> Start Session -> Load from file. The app will ask you for the associated video first, then the .pkl file.
If you are starting a new set of notes, go to File -> Start Session -> New, then provide the video file you want to take notes on.
### Adding and editing a note
Use the slider and the play-pause button to stop at a frame. You can add a note by clicking on the bottom left "Add Note" button. Double-clicking on a note takes you to the timestamp it refers to in the video. Selecting the note in the list on the left enables the "Edit" button. After editing the content of a note, click on the same button to save changes.
### Comments
You can leave comments on a note by selecting it and clicking on the "Comment" button. Comments can only be left on a note and can't be edited. If you don't like what you've entered, you can delete a comment or a note by selecting it and clicking on the "Delete" button.
### Tags and filters
You can add tags to a note. The available tags are, as you can see at the bottom right of the window:
* General
* Sound
* Music
* Colour
* VFX

Using the drop-down menu at the top right corner, you can filter notes based on the tags you assigned to them.
### Exporting and saving
Go to File -> Save to save changes. If you imported a notes file to begin with, the app will save changes to the file you imported. To save changes to a new notes file, go to File -> Save as...
