## Releases
Releases can be found [here](https://github.com/JackyKLai/directors-notes/releases).
## Usage
### Getting Started
Notes are stored in a data file in the .pkl format. If you have a notes file ready, go to File -> Start Session -> Load from file. The app will ask you for the associated video first, then the .pkl file.
If you are starting a new set of notes, go to File -> Start Session -> New, then provide the video file you want to take notes on.
### Adding and editing a note
Use the slider and the play-pause button to stop at a frame. You can add a note by clicking on the bottom left "Add Note" button. Double-clicking on a note takes you to the timestamp it refers to in the video. To edit a note, right click on its text box and select "Edit." To save changes, right click on the text box again and press "Save."
### Comments
You can leave comments on a note by right clicking on it and pressing "Comment." Comments can only be left on a note and can't be edited. If you don't like what you've entered, you can delete a comment or a note by selecting it and clicking on the "Delete" button.
### Tags
You can assign tags to a note. You will need to create tags by going to Manage->Tags before assigning them to your notes.
After defining your tags, they will be available as checkboxes. You will have access to them once you have selected a note.
Using the drop-down menu at the top right corner, you can filter notes based on the tags you assigned to them.
### Attachments
You can attach image files to a note. To do this, right click on a note and select "Attach Images." If a note already has images attached to it, right clicking on it gives you the "Show Attachments" option.
### Exporting and saving
Go to File -> Save to save changes. If you imported a notes file to begin with, the app will save changes to the file you imported. To save changes as a new notes file, go to File -> Save as...
Use "CTRL + C" and "CLRL + A" ("command + C" and "command + A" on Mac) are available as shortcuts.
